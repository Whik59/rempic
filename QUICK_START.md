## 🖼️ Next Steps - Add Your Images:

### 1. Replace Placeholder Images
The page currently uses SVG placeholders. Replace them with your actual app screenshots:

**Hero Section Image** (`public/hero-phone.png`):

**Benefits Section Image** (`public/benefits-phone.png`):
- Show accounts or money management features
- Recommended: 600x1200px (phone aspect ratio)

### 2. Tips for Best Results:
- Use PNG format with transparent backgrounds
- High resolution (2x for retina displays)
- Optimize file size (<500KB per image)
- You can use tools like TinyPNG to compress
